# Whatʼs new in Swift 4

An Xcode playground showcasing the new features in Swift 4.0.

Written by [Ole Begemann][Ole Begemann], May 2017.

The playground requires Swift 4. Xcode 9 includes Swift 4 by default ([download Xcode 9 beta from developer.apple.com][Xcode 9]). You can also run it in Xcode 8.3, but you need to install [the latest Swift 4.0 snapshot from swift.org][Snapshot downloads] (donʼt worry, itʼs easy).
